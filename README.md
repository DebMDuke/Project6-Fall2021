# Project 6-Spring 2022
Starter code for assignment

**Programming Project 6 – Graph Methods Implementation**

**_Note: When you turn in an assignment to be graded in this class, you are making the claim that you neither gave nor received assistance on the work you turned in (except, of course, assistance from your instructor). Any assistance from other sources, including the internet, is an honor code violation._**

In this project, you’ll begin with starter code for a Graph interface, an Edge class, and a class that represents an unweighted graph, UnweightedGraph.  You will extend the UnweightedGraph class by implementing a class called MyCustomGraph that adds functionality as specifiec in the Canvas assignment.
